# OXVGUI
> Fast, web-based OXVG interface to compress, optimize, and minify SVG images. Reduce file size, clean graphics, and preview changes instantly!

[OXVGUI](https://oxvgui.jonasgeiler.com/) is an **[OXVG](https://github.com/noahbald/oxvg)** **U**ser **I**nterface, aiming to expose the majority, if not all the configuration options of OXVG.

This is a fork of [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) using OXVG instead of SVGO, which aims to be faster and more accurate than SVGO written in Rust.
